# Acknowledgements

This project would be nothing without the hard work of many (awesome) open-source projects. An exhaustive list would take pages, here I mention only a crucial subset:

- Python-based HDL and SoC framework: The [Amaranth HDL](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth) and [Amaranth SoC](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth-soc) projects.
- USB and SoC gateware: The [LUNA and Cynthion](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/luna/) projects.
- RISCV softcore: The [VexRiscv and SpinalHDL projects](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv)
- USB audio gateware and descriptors: The [adat-usb2-audio-interface](https://github.com/hansfbaier/adat-usb2-audio-interface) project.
- Some gateware (e.g. I2C state machines) are inherited from the [Glasgow](https://github.com/GlasgowEmbedded/glasgow) project.
- Audio interface and gateware: my existing [eurorack-pmod](https://github.com/apfaudio/eurorack-pmod) project.
- SID emulation gateware: [reDIP-SID](https://github.com/daglem/reDIP-SID)
- The "mi-plaits-dsp-rs" project: [mi-plaits-dsp](https://github.com/sourcebox/mi-plaits-dsp-rs)
- The "pico-dirtyJtag" project forms a big chunk of the RP2040 firmware [pico-dirtyJtag](https://github.com/phdussud/pico-dirtyJtag)

## Funding

We would like to acknowledge partial funding of the [Tiliqua project](https://nlnet.nl/project/Tiliqua/) from the [NGI Commons Fund](https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund), a fund established by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) with financial support from the European Commission’s [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu/) program.
