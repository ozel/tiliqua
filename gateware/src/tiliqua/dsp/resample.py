class Resample(wiring.Component):

    """
    Polyphase fractional resampler.

    Upsamples by factor N, filters the result, then downsamples by factor M.
    The upsampling action zero-pads before applying the low-pass filter, so
    the low-pass filter coefficients are prescaled by N to preserve total energy.

    The underlying FIR interpolator only performs MACs on non-padded input samples,
    (and for output samples which are not discarded), which can make a big difference
    for large upsampling/interpolating ratios, and is what makes this a polyphase
    resampler - time complexity per output sample proportional to O(fir_order/N).

            Numerator of the resampling ratio. Samples are produced at :py:`fs_in * (n_up / m_down)`.
            If :py:`n_up` and :py:`m_down` share a common factor, the internal resampling ratio is reduced.

            Bandwidth (0 to 1, proportion of the nyquist frequency) of the resampling filter.
        order_mult : int
            Filter order multiplier, determines number of taps in underlying FIR filter. The
